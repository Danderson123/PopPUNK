Fitting new models
==================



.. _manual-start:

Using fit refinement when mixture model totally fails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the mixture model does not give any sort of reasonable fit to the points,
you can manually provide a file with ``--manual-start`` to give the starting parameters to
``--refine-fit`` mode. The format of this file is as follows::

    mean0 0,0
    mean1 0.5,0.6
    start_point 0.3

A key, followed by its value (space separated).

``mean0`` and ``mean1`` define the points (x,y) to draw the line between, and
``start_point`` is the distance along this line to draw the initial boundary
(which is normal to the line).
