Using PopPUNK-web
=================
This feature is coming soon, and will be documented here when available.

If you are analysing *S. pnuemoniae* genomes you can add them to http://pathogen.watch/
(tax ID 1313) and a PopPUNK cluster, also known as a global pneumococcal sequence cluster (GPSC),
will be assigned to each of your inputs. See https://www.pneumogen.net/gps/assigningGPSCs.html for
a video demonstration.
